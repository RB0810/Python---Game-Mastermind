# Python : Game-Mastermind

**Background of Game:**<br>
Our game is called mastermind. The inspiration comes from a board game most of us
played as children (especially in India).<br>
It is a game that involves mathematical permutation and combinations, without actual
theoretical solutions. Hence, the player unknowingly puts his knowledge to test whilst
having fun, developing critical thinking; which we feel is probably one of the most
important skills one should have.<br>
The game is basically to guess the combination/sequence of colours as chosen by the
computer using hints and indicators being provided from time to time.
